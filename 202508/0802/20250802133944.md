### **1.3 Third Party Open Source Software**  
#### **Key Points:**  
1. **Definition**:  
   - The commercial software may include third-party open-source components ("Open Source Software") with their own license terms.  
   - These licenses are typically listed on a designated Elastic website.  

2. **License Terms Govern Open Source Software**:  
   - The terms of the open-source licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT, GPL) take precedence over this agreement for the respective components.  
   - If there is a conflict between this agreement and the open-source license, the open-source license prevails **only for that specific component**.  

3. **Elastic’s Own Open Source Software**:  
   - Some open-source software is provided directly by Elastic (e.g., Elasticsearch under Apache 2.0).  
   - Such software is **not governed by this commercial agreement** but by its applicable open-source license.  

#### **Implications**:  
- Users must comply with the terms of each embedded open-source component.  
- Elastic ensures that open-source licenses do not restrict the commercial rights granted under this agreement.

### **2. Commercial Software Source Code**  
#### **2.1 Limited License**  
- **Grant**: Elastic provides a **free**, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to the **source code** for internal use, subject to:  
  - **No circumvention**: Users must not bypass licensing mechanisms to unlock paid features.  
  - **Testing only**: Derivative works (modifications) can only be used for **non-production testing**.  

#### **2.2 Restrictions**  
- **No Production Use**: Derivative works **cannot** be deployed in production.  
- **No Distribution**: Source code (or modifications) cannot be shared, sold, or licensed to third parties.  
- **Public Repositories Allowed**: Users may host a **public copy** of the source repository **only if** this agreement is included.  

#### **Implications**:  
- Developers can modify and test the code but **cannot** use custom builds in live environments.  
- Prevents unauthorized commercialization of Elastic’s proprietary code.

### **3. Termination**  
#### **3.1 Automatic Termination**  
- The agreement terminates **immediately** if the user breaches any terms (e.g., using source code in production).  

#### **3.2 Post-Termination Obligations**  
- Users must **stop all use** of:  
  - **Object Code** (compiled binaries).  
  - **Source Code** (except for Apache 2.0-licensed code, which remains usable).  

#### **3.3 Survival Clause**  
- Certain sections (e.g., restrictions, disclaimers, liability limits) remain enforceable even after termination.  

#### **Implications**:  
- Elastic retains legal recourse for violations.  
- Open-source components (under permissive licenses) remain usable post-termination.  

---  

### **4. Disclaimer of Warranties & Limitation of Liability**  
- **Disclaimer**: The software is provided **"as-is"** without warranties (e.g., no guarantees of performance or fitness for purpose).  
- **Liability Cap**: Elastic’s liability is typically limited to the amount paid by the user (if any).  

#### **Implications**:  
- Users assume all risk for using the software.  
- Protects Elastic from lawsuits over indirect damages (e.g., lost profits).

### **Summary of Key Takeaways**  
1. **Open-Source vs. Commercial Code**:  
   - Open-source components follow their own licenses.  
   - Elastic’s proprietary code is strictly controlled (no production use of modifications).  

2. **Source Code Access ≠ Unlimited Rights**:  
   - Modifications are allowed **only for testing**.  
   - No redistribution or commercial exploitation.  

3. **Termination = Immediate Shutdown**:  
   - Breach results in loss of all commercial rights (but open-source rights persist).  

4. **No Legal Guarantees**:  
   - Elastic disclaims responsibility for software defects or business losses.  

This structure ensures Elastic protects its intellectual property while complying with open-source obligations. Users must carefully adhere to license boundaries to avoid termination.
